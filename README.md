## 🚀 About Me

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a **Java-based payroll system** and other project-based coursework that helps build practical skills in OOP, file handling, and data persistence.  
- 🌱 I’m studying Computer Science and working on research related to **customer drink-customization in cafés** — exploring how customization affects customer satisfaction and operations.  
- 💡 I enjoy building apps (web/mobile), experimenting with UI/UX, and learning new programming paradigms.  
- 📷 In my free time, I do “phonetography” — capturing moments via photography (my upcoming portfolio site: *Sairil’s Phonetography*).

## 📂 Projects I'm Proud Of / Learning Through

| Project / Area | Description / What I Learned |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| **Java Payroll System** | A comprehensive payroll system handling multiple employee types, historical salary tracking, overtime/holiday pay, and file-based persistence. Great OOP, exception handling, and design-pattern practice. |
| **College Projects (Web / Mobile)** | PHP + MySQL forms handling, front-end basics, research-based projects like the customization-study for cafés. |
| **Portfolio / Phonetography Site (Upcoming)** | Building a personal website to showcase photography and personal profile — working on layout, gallery organization, and responsive design. |
| **Flutter UI Components Repo** | Exploring modern UI in Flutter / Dart, building reusable widgets/components. |

## ✨ Fun Facts & Interests

- I love **photography** — capturing daily life, landscapes, and events through my lens.  
- I enjoy **learning new things** — whether it’s a new language, a design pattern, or a bit of UI/UX.  
- Coffee ☕ + coding = my comfort zone.  
- I’m curious about **how technology and human behavior intersect** — which feeds into my research on café customer customization.

## 🔭 What’s Next — Roadmap

- [ ] Launch *Sairil’s Phonetography* portfolio website (Home, About, Gallery)  
- [ ] Polish and publish Java Payroll project as a sample for download/use  
- [ ] Build more mobile/web apps — maybe open source — to experiment with UI/UX + practical use cases  
- [ ] Contribute to open-source (even small bug fixes or documentation) to get more exposure & collaborative experience
